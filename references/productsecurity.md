## Instructions and Binaries/Executables

Binary (Binaries) can also be called executables contain complete software that makes a product work as expected are stored in memory (Though not exactly SD Card...can consider as SD Card for storing photos, documents,...). 

Binaries are considered as packages of series of 0s and 1s representing instructions for CPU. Instructions are statements telling CPU what needs to be done (like read a number from a memory location, another number from another memory location, add the two numbers, store the sum into another memory location). 

When these instructions are executed by CPU, the intended functionality of the product is realized. For example, instructions in binaries in TV when executed realizes the functionality of TV and users can select the videos and watch them along with audio in TV. Similarly, mobile phones (When instructions in binaries in TV when executed realizes the functionality of mobile phone).

Though, here, binary is explained as software for the complete product, binary can be individual application that runs on already functional product. For example, already functional mobile phone can download an application and new functionality is introduced in the product/Mobile phone. This individual application can also be called as binary.

## Bootloader

A component called bootloader is stored in a location that is very secure (That is almost sure that no one can hack). The location where bootloader is stored can be accessed by CPU.

When a product is powered on, contents of this(ese) binaries are read by the bootloader and will be copied into memory location which CPU can access. This(ese) binaries include instructions that CPU follows/executes.
